# GitHub Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to integrate GitHub as a storage backend for the wiki system, allowing seamless switching between local file storage and GitHub storage.

## Prerequisites
1. GitHub Personal Access Token with the following permissions:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (Optional, for GitHub Actions if needed)

## Configuration Setup
1. Update configuration file structure to include GitHub settings:
   ```yaml
   storage_mode: "github"  # or "local"
   github:
     token: "your-github-token"
     owner: "your-username"
     repository: "your-wiki-repo"
     branch: "main"
   ```

## Security Considerations
1. Secure storage of GitHub token
2. Rate limiting handling
3. Error handling for API limits
4. Proper access control

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling for network issues
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Add logging for GitHub operations
- Consider implementing a queue system for multiple updates
